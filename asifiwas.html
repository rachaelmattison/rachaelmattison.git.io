<h1> AS IF I WAS DOING WORK RESPONSE </h1>
<p>
	This one was fun, I really enjoyed the aesthetic. It kind of took me a minute to realize I could press any key and it would just type the words it is programed to type, yet it looks like I'm typing it, and it was a beautiful message. Which was also a tasteful after thought, making it seem like the user was typing it, sort of projecting our own thoughts even though it wasn't the users original thoughts. 

I also enjoy the part when more windows just pot up and make the user actually type out something specific to continue to use the rest of the desktop, it kind of gives the sensation of like oh yeah I'm the user I'm still in control of this computer. 
And the opening sound effect, nostalgic dell computer opening,

	I like how there's an on or off option for music, personally did not enjoy the music but I think it corresponded with the website nicely. 
- Low-key creepy
- not sure what to do once I completed it 
- funny how the music started to change 
- it's applying a real human sensation to a computer, but making it seem like the computer has a personality, a voice and feeling 
- it's pretty cool, extremely creative
