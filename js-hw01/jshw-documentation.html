<p> 
I am having a bit gf trouble trying to understand the function's event, how to code them...
And I am trying to understand the actual action each type of function does exactly, and what elements each function requires to work. 

On the body element I had two functions on there, on scroll and keypressdown and it confused the computer, but it was still performing both and when the I pressed the down key to scroll it was flashing magenta and then red which gave a cool effect, 

But the magenta occurs when you press ANY key, doesn't have to be the down arrow key...
