	<h1> 1-10 Borscht Recipes </h1>
	<p> For this assignment I really stuck with the 'traditional' structure of a recipe because the repetition of creating that layout helped me grasp a better understanding of the elements I was using. I think I could have given my structure a little more freedom and look at the information I was formatting in a more creative way. </p>

<h1> 10-20 Borscht Recipies </h1>
<p> Once I got the Hang on the effects certain css features had like, margin-left, padding, position: absolute, I was able to play around with it more. I really enjoyed using super large font sizes, I think that added a nice interaction with the user because they have  to scroll so much.</p>
