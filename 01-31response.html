<p> TOO MUCH WORLD, IS THE INTERNET DEAD? 

"...what happened to the internet after it stopped being a possibility?" 

Television infused itself into the internet and set the bar for the idea of an image. Something mimicked, or captured from nature, or a real life situation and digitalized it, froze it, and stored it in a place that any user who knew how, could access it, view it, and feel something about it, have a reaction to it, have a reason for looking for it, and looking at it. 

But the image is altered and not in its raw form. Isn't that kind of a great way to explain the internet and how the user utilizes it? 


"...basically everybodyâ€”have noticed that the internet feels awkward, too. It is obviously completely surveilled, monopolized, and sanitized by common sense, copyright, control, and conformism."
	- The internet is not dead, it is everywhere, for everyone to see, but also every part of it is regulated and watched. 


So even when we turn off our phone or close our computer, we seem to be "unplugged." But the internet still lives and breathes and sleeps and exists whether or not we are using it, someone else always is, which means it's always there. And we wake up and use it some more. In this continuous, inevitable cycle that keeps the internet alive and especially growing. 

"Reality now consists of images; or rather, of things, constellations, and processes formerly evident as images." 
	Everyday we live our daily lives, unaware of our surroundings, or possibly not realizing the effect or bulk of what consist of our surroundings, images.
