<h2> JQuery Homework Documentation 03_07_20 </h2>
<p>
	I found using jquery was a bit easier than javascript because it is more direct, and the syntax is similar to css. I'm not sure which I like yet, I think they are very similar, but I am interested to figure out if certain things work better by using javascript or by using jquery.
