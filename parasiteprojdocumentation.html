<h1> PARASITE PROJECT PROGRESS DOCUMENTATION </h1>

<em> 03_15_20 </em>
So, I have a central idea for the theme of my Supreme parasite project, it is going to act like a time machine parasite. Taking the website back to its origins of the company. Even though the general interface has been almost the exact same since 2007, its content and possibly structure will go back to its beginning in April 1994 :) 

	- maybe I'll have the website open up and immediately play a video from 1994, then end and go back to the beginning of the website and then the more things you click on the more it changes and goes back. 
			* I also definitely want to create new elements within what exist, because I need a consistent, somewhat motive to move the website parasite forward. 
				- maybe every time the user clicks next on like the shop page it changes to an older and older vintage supreme piece.

<ol> ****on the supreme website now they have an alert message at the top that addresses the coronavirus saying they're closing their stores. This is weird bc im doing a parasite project, which kind of corresponds with this idea of virus -- parasite </ol> 



Maybe at the end of it all the entire website should just turn into a Barbara Kruger piece? 

		<ol> <ol> {{ I feel like the supreme website is so simple and it's trying so hard to give off this sleek, low-key vibe, which is kind of the opposite of its apparel and cultural aura? at least in my opinion. SO what can be said about how I should go about acting as a parasite to that kind of website? I feel like I want to make it have a vibe more like their brand? Which is I don't know care-free skaters, colorful, loose, street-style, a bit angsty? }} </ol> </ol>
