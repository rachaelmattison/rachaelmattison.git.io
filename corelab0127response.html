Internet's impact on art, and art's impact on the internet 
(Designers merge the two) 

WEBSITE: a website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. 
A server is a computer that's always connected to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. 
	You have to pay for a server.  
	You have to pay for a domain name. 



Today we have to be aware that the web is different, the web is US, and WE now have more social and political freedom, AND responsibility. 
	"...technological friction and social pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018." 



				"Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you. It makes perfect sense, then, when individuals tell me they want their website to do the job of “setting the record straight” on who they are and what they do."

	***Today a lot of companies interfaces, specifically social media platforms, prioritize advertising, and making the user feel like they want to have the things being showcased to them, or worse making them believe they need it. 
		This is crucial because today the world is so connected and that is shown through social media, yet negative feelings evoke out of the user a lot of the time... so why do we keep using it? If technology and the web is something that can make our lives better, make us happier why is social media making it cause the complete opposite? 





This idea of A website, but if I can make one I can make another, so why not. Why limit my idea of websites, the web and the internet when there's endless possibilities. 


We need individuals to lead the future of the web so we all don't become clones of each other, ew. Because at this rate platforms like facebook, google, instagram, twitter are controlling, directing, and demanding our mindset of the internet and web. 


"A website can compliment what you already do..."

To me, my idea of a website is changing, it's almost like a digital sketchbook. 
I go through sketchbooks within 3 months or so, and imagine that in a digital, online, and PUBLIC version. That's dope.

WEBSITE AS A PUDDLE:
