							WEBSITE HOMEPAGES: 



<br>
http://art.teleportacia.org/olia.html

	- This website feels very personal, goofy lighthearted, yet organized and professional 
	- it's not hard to read or navigate, yet you have to play around a little bit to see and explore the entire site which keeps it interesting and intriguing. 
	- there's a lot to see on each page, but also a lot the user doesn't see 
	- has a raw-coding-looking aesthetic to it, that makes it tasteful because you can see all her intentions, she's not hiding anything, clean cut straight forward and unique.

	- I love the color scheme of this website and how it allows the typefaces to shine and not distract from the beauty of them. 
	- just realized, the colors remind me of the blue and white of the iPhone iMessage text interface, so it's probably comforting to look at for users (iPhone use4rs) because its a familiar and calming color combination.

	- this is a DOPE website, 
	- it's really simple, but has subtle really tasteful features to it: my favorite is when you scroll the background color gradates from a pale yellow to pale blue to pale pink.

	- another dope website, that paid attention to how the distracted youth pays attention, barely, and they literally state it, at the top of the homepage, in the first sentence the user looks at. 
	- every time you click on the courser it leaves a yellow dot, which is beautiful and creates this primary color scheme, and becomes an interactive homepage that allows the user to create it/ contribute to it, and is a unique experience.

	- this website is like an entire animation, it's a bit distracting from the information trying to reach the user, but overall a wonderful experience 
	- pretty, yet basic color scheme, seen a lot throughout design today.
