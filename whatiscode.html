	<h1> Paul Ford: What Is Code? <em> Reading Response </em> </h1>

	<p>

"I'd happily talk to people from Google or Apple but they so rarely reenter the general population." 

	lmao 

...the world-wide web is what I know best 
But the web is only one small part of the larger world of software development. 


"A computer is a clock with benefits. They all work the same, doing second-grade math, one step at a time: 

		- a computer is documentation of time, but what is time? Computer is a time-based medium, this reminds me of how javascript functions, it reads what the user tells it to do in chronological order, and performs those actions sequentially in an extremely, extremely short amount of time. 

"You, using pen and paper can do anything a computer can; you just can't do those things billions of times per second." 
			This helps me put computer programming into perspective, because going into this I had some fears of the computer, not knowing how to utilize it because I am overwhelmed with how much it can do, but essentially I can do whatever the computer can do, it just does it faster.   And understanding that will help me build a strong structure of computer language.
