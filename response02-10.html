<h2> <em> METAPHORS We Live By</em>;  George Lakoff and Mark Johnson  </h2>
<ul><ul><ul><p>
	The concept that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, our concepts structure what we perceive 
				<br>*** this is basically when we associate everything to something already stored in our minds, and warp our ideas of whatever that is. 
						<br>So as a designer, how do we demand they a viewer, or user sees or utilizes something, or do we not have control over that inevitably? 
		<br>"but our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of" 
					** do we know how to access our subconscious or turn it off, or turn it on? Or is it always there it's never off. ~ kind of like the internet, it's never off it's always there. 

"Communication is based on some conceptual system," 
			language is how we function, it is the vehicle of all civilization, politics, society, community, relationship, communication is everything, everywhere, constantly. So is the internet a further development of communication, a second version of language, a second version of communication? Or is it the ultimate communication? 



"Metaphorical in nature" 

Nature is the basis of everything that exists today, we have learned and discovered EVERYTHING that exists from nature. 
<h3>Is technology nature? </h3>
